# ESP-NOW-Controller
A fully-functional RC car system using two ESP32 boards, one as a Transmitter (remote) and another as a Receiver (car controller). Communication happens through ESP-NOW (low-latency, Wi-Fi-free protocol). The receiver drives two BTS7960 motor drivers for differential steering. Speed is controlled via a potentiometer on the remote.
